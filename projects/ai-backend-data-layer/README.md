# Production AI Backend Data Layer

The evolving Phase 3 engineering artifact. It turns the Day28 conceptual ownership rule —
**PostgreSQL owns durable Job truth** — into an executable, failure-aware data layer, one lesson at a
time (Day29-Day42).

Current increment: **Day29 — the first minimal raw SQL Job schema.**

Lesson: [`docs/postgresql/day29-postgresql-foundations-and-durable-relational-state.md`](../../docs/postgresql/day29-postgresql-foundations-and-durable-relational-state.md)

> **Deviation from `projects/README.md` (stated honestly):** the generic project template lists
> `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `src/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`. Day29 produced only a README and one
> raw SQL file, so nothing else exists yet. Empty folders and placeholder executables are deliberately
> **not** created; the structure will grow as later Phase 3 lessons produce real content. No ORM is
> used — SQLAlchemy/Alembic are Phase 4.

## What this schema is for

```text
Client uploads a verified 500 MB document
-> FastAPI writes (and commits) the Job row      <-- THIS FILE
-> FastAPI returns 202 + job_id
-> a worker later claims the queued Job
```

The row must exist **before** `202` is returned. `202` acknowledges a commitment that already exists
durably; if the API Pod is replaced a millisecond later, the Job is still recoverable.

## Ownership decisions

```text
PostgreSQL     -> the Job row: identity, state, timestamps, counters, flags, references (durable truth)
Object Storage -> the 500 MB source document and large derived artifacts (result_object_key is a REFERENCE)
Redis / Queue  -> transient transport/cache only (not modeled here, not run in Day29)
Process memory -> request-local only; never durable truth
```

Column intent:

| Column | Type | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| `job_id` | `uuid` PK, `DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` | stable row identity; distributed + non-enumerable |
| `job_status` | `text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'queued'` | evolving lifecycle state |
| `attempt_count` | `integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` | retry bookkeeping |
| `cancel_requested` | `boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` | cooperative cancellation flag |
| `provider_metadata` | `jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb` | **bounded** auxiliary metadata only |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` | immutable acceptance instant |
| `started_at` | `timestamptz` NULL | NULL -> execution has not started |
| `finished_at` | `timestamptz` NULL | NULL -> not terminal yet |
| `error_message` | `text` NULL | NULL -> no recorded error |
| `result_object_key` | `text` NULL | NULL -> no result artifact yet (Object Storage reference) |

## Reproduce the Day29 validation (disposable PostgreSQL)

These are the commands for a **throwaway local cluster**. No credentials, no shared database, no
production connection string. Adjust paths for your machine.

```bash
# 1. Create and start a disposable cluster (PostgreSQL must be installed locally).
export PGDATA="$(mktemp -d)/data"
initdb -D "$PGDATA" >/dev/null
pg_ctl -D "$PGDATA" -o "-p 5433 -k /tmp" -l "$PGDATA/server.log" start

# 2. Create the database and apply the schema.
createdb -p 5433 -h /tmp ai_backend
psql -p 5433 -h /tmp -d ai_backend -f sql/001_create_jobs.sql

# 3. Prove the defaults come from the database contract (every business field omitted).
psql -p 5433 -h /tmp -d ai_backend -c "INSERT INTO app.jobs DEFAULT VALUES RETURNING *;"

# 4. Session/namespace diagnostics.
psql -p 5433 -h /tmp -d ai_backend -c "\conninfo"
psql -p 5433 -h /tmp -d ai_backend -c "SELECT current_database(), current_user, current_schema();"
psql -p 5433 -h /tmp -d ai_backend -c "SHOW search_path;"
psql -p 5433 -h /tmp -d ai_backend -c "\dt app.*"

# 5. Stop and delete the cluster when finished.
pg_ctl -D "$PGDATA" stop
rm -rf "$(dirname "$PGDATA")"
```

Docker was **not** used: the Docker CLI existed during class but the daemon was not running. Do not
present a Docker workflow as validated.

## Validation matrix

| Level | Day29 status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Conceptual / manual review | **Done** | Responsibility, type, NULL/DEFAULT, identity, and repair reasoning reviewed in class |
| SQL syntax / DDL acceptance | **Done (PostgreSQL 14.18)** | `CREATE SCHEMA` + `CREATE TABLE app.jobs` executed successfully |
| Real disposable-PostgreSQL behavior | **Done (selected behaviors)** | defaults, NOT NULL rejection, timestamptz rendering, guarded repair, restart persistence (below) |
| Re-run during this repository update | **NOT RUN** | no `psql`/PostgreSQL server/Docker daemon was available in the repository-update environment |
| Application integration (FastAPI/Celery) | **NOT DONE** | no service was created or connected |
| Production validation | **NOT DONE** | no deployment, HA, backup/restore, or load evidence |

### Verified in class (PostgreSQL 14.18, disposable cluster)

```text
- CREATE SCHEMA and CREATE TABLE succeeded.
- gen_random_uuid() was available and produced a UUID.
- INSERT ... DEFAULT VALUES RETURNING * produced queued / 0 / false / {} / created_at,
  with started_at, finished_at, error_message, result_object_key returned as NULL.
- Explicit job_status NULL failed with a not-null constraint violation.
- Empty job_status AND 'banana' were both ACCEPTED  -> the known missing business constraint.
- The same created_at rendered as 2026-07-19 12:32:00.454132+00 (UTC) and
  2026-07-19 20:32:00.454132+08 (Asia/Shanghai); both had epoch 1784464320.454132.
- Guarded repair drill: three 'queud' rows inserted (baseline empty=1, banana=1, queud=3, queued=1);
  UPDATE ... WHERE job_status = 'queud' reported UPDATE 3 and RETURNING listed the three repaired
  job_ids; post-repair counts were empty=1, banana=1, queued=4.
- PostgreSQL was stopped and restarted; all 6 rows remained (queued=4, banana=1, empty=1).

Session context: database ai_backend, schema app, user yuanzhenyu,
search_path "$user", public; current_schema public (explicit app.jobs succeeded);
session timezone Asia/Shanghai.
```

**Not proven by the restart test:** backup recovery, high availability, crash durability under hardware
failure, or production reliability. It showed local process-lifecycle persistence only.

## Known gaps (deliberate — future lessons)

```text
Day30  SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/RETURNING, NULL logic, parameterized SQL, guarded transitions
Day31  CHECK (valid job_status, attempt_count >= 0), UNIQUE business/idempotency key, tenant ownership,
       Documents / Job Attempts / Job Events / Outbox Events / Result Artifact refs, foreign keys
Day33  transactions (atomic Job + Outbox insert)
Day34  concurrency-safe claims (FOR UPDATE / SKIP LOCKED), leases, idempotency enforcement
Day35  indexes and query plans
Day36  versioned migrations (this file is a starting point, not a migration framework)
Day37  pooling, roles/least privilege, timeouts, vacuum, backup/PITR, operations
```

Today's schema is durable but **not yet correct-by-construction**: a misspelled `queud` status is
accepted, stored forever, and never claimed by a worker. Durability is not integrity.
