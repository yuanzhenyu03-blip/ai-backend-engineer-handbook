# Curriculum

This file defines the official curriculum for the AI Backend Engineer Training Camp.

The curriculum is not a list of topics.

It is an engineering training plan. Every lesson must connect concept understanding, production risk, framework usage, coding practice, interview readiness, and repository updates.

## Phase 1 — Python Foundations

### Day01

Topic:
Python Object Model

Status:
✅ Completed

Released Lesson:
`docs/python/day01-object-model.md`

---

### Day02

Topic:
Mutable vs Immutable

Status:
✅ Completed

Difficulty:
Foundation

Estimated Study Time:
4-5 hours

Prerequisites:

- Day01 — Python Object Model
- Names, references, and object identity
- `==` vs `is`
- Mutable default argument bug

Learning Objectives:

- Understand mutable and immutable objects.
- Learn how object identity connects to mutability.
- Understand shallow copy vs deep copy.
- Explain why mutable default arguments are dangerous.
- Connect the concept to FastAPI and Playwright.

Key Concepts:

- Mutable objects
- Immutable objects
- Object identity
- Shared references
- Copy
- Deep copy
- Hashability

Engineering Thinking:

- Which objects are safe to share?
- Which objects should be copied?
- Which objects should be isolated per request or per job?
- How can hidden mutation create production bugs?

Deliverables:

- Day02 lesson document
- Python cheat sheet update
- Python interview notes update
- Coding exercises

Homework:

- Copy exercises
- `id()` experiments
- Memory diagrams

Mini Project:

Implement a simple object inspector.

Interview Focus:

- Explain mutable vs immutable objects.
- Explain shallow copy vs deep copy.
- Explain why tuple can be hashable but list cannot.
- Explain how shared mutable state causes backend bugs.

Repository Updates:

- `docs/python/day02-mutable-vs-immutable.md`
- `cheat_sheets/python.md`
- `interview/python.md`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `TASKS.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
